     <h1>INTRODUCTION OF CSS 1</h1>
     <P>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. Essentially, it's how you make your web pages visually appealing by controlling things like colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. </P>

 <H2>INTRODUCTION OF CSS 2</H2>
 <P>CSS allows you to separate the content of your website (written in HTML) from its visual presentation. This makes your code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more organized. 
 </P>
 <H3>INTRODUCTION OF CSS 3</H3>
 <P>You use CSS to define rules that tell browsers how to display different HTML elements. 
Enables Reusability:
You can write CSS rules once and apply them to multiple HTML pages, saving time and effort. </P>
<H4>INTRODUCTION OF CSS 4</H4>
<P>Improves Website Speed and SEO:
By separating content and presentation, CSS can help improve website speed and search engine optimization (SEO). 
How CSS works:
Syntax:
CSS syntax consists of selectors and declarations. Selectors target specific HTML elements, and declarations define the styles to be applied (e.g., color, font size, etc.). </P>
<H5>INTRODUCTION OF CSS 5</H5>
<P>Cascading:
CSS uses a "cascading" system, meaning that multiple style rules can be applied to the same element, and the browser resolves conflicts based on priority and specificity. 
Types of CSS:
Inline CSS: Applied directly within HTML elements using the style attribute. 
<H6>INTRODUCTION OF CSS 6</H6>

<P>Key Concepts:
Selectors: Used to target HTML elements (e.g., p for paragraphs, h1 for headings). 
Properties: Attributes that define the visual style (e.g., color, font-size, margin). 
Values: Specific settings for properties (e.g., red, 16px, 10px). 
Specificity: Determines which style rules take precedence when multiple rules apply to the same element. 
The Cascade: The process of how styles are applied based on priority and order. </P>
