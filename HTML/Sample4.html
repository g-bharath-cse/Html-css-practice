</head>
<body>
    <H1>INTRODUCTION OF PYTHON 1</H1>
    <P>Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It's widely used in various domains, including web development, data science, machine learning, and scripting. Python is interpreted, object-oriented, and supports multiple programming paradigms. </P>
    <H2>INTRODUCTION OF PYTHON 2</H2>
    <P>High-level:
Python abstracts away many low-level details, making it easier for developers to focus on the logic of their code. 
Interpreted:
Python code is executed by an interpreter, line by line, rather than being compiled into machine code before running. </P>
<H3>INTRODUCTION OF PYTHON 3</H3>
<P>Object-oriented:
Python supports object-oriented programming principles, allowing for modular and reusable code. 
Dynamically Typed:
Python determines the type of a variable at runtime, rather than requiring explicit type declarations. </P>
<H4>INTRODUCTION OF PYTHON 4</H4>
<P>Readability:
Python's syntax emphasizes clear and concise code, making it easy to read and understand. 
Extensible:
Python can be extended with code written in other languages like C or C++, enhancing its capabilities. </P>
<H5>INTRODUCTION OF PYTHON 5</H5>
<P>Widely Used:
Python is a popular choice for many applications, including web development (using frameworks like Django and Flask), data analysis (with libraries like Pandas and NumPy), machine learning (with libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow), and scripting tasks. </P>
<H6>INTRODUCTION OF PYTHON 6</H6> 
<P>Ease of Learning:
Python's syntax is designed to be straightforward, making it a great language for beginners. 
Large Community and Libraries:
Python boasts a large and active community, providing ample resources, libraries, and frameworks for various tasks. </P>
